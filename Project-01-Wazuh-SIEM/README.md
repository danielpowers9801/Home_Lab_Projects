# Wazuh SIEM Home Lab — Deployment and Initial Configuration

**Project 01 · Security Monitoring Infrastructure · October 2026**

## Overview

This project involved deploying a self-hosted Wazuh security monitoring platform in an Ubuntu Server virtual machine using Oracle VirtualBox. The goal was to establish a foundation for endpoint monitoring, centralized security event analysis, and threat detection in a controlled lab environment.

The deployment includes the core Wazuh components: the manager, indexer, and dashboard. This lab provides an environment for exploring security monitoring workflows, analyzing security events, and developing practical SIEM administration and detection capabilities.

## Objectives

- Deploy a self-hosted Wazuh security monitoring platform.
- Configure an Ubuntu Server environment to host the platform.
- Establish virtual machine networking for lab connectivity and management.
- Understand the roles of the Wazuh manager, indexer, and dashboard.
- Prepare the environment for future endpoint monitoring and detection testing.

## Technology Stack

- **SIEM:** Wazuh
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu Server 24.04.5 LTS
- **Virtualization:** Oracle VirtualBox
- **Networking:** NAT and host-only networking
- **Core Components:** Wazuh manager, Wazuh indexer, Wazuh dashboard

## Lab Environment

The Wazuh platform was deployed within a dedicated virtual machine configured with the following resources:

| Resource | Configuration |
|---|---|
| Virtualization platform | Oracle VirtualBox |
| Operating system | Ubuntu Server 24.04.5 LTS |
| Virtual CPUs | 4 |
| Memory | 8 GB RAM |
| Virtual disk | 100 GB |
| Network configuration | NAT and host-only networking |

## Architecture

The lab uses Wazuh's core components to provide the foundation for security monitoring:

- **Wazuh Manager:** Receives and analyzes security data from monitored endpoints and processes security events according to configured rules.
- **Wazuh Indexer:** Stores and indexes security data to support searching and analysis.
- **Wazuh Dashboard:** Provides a web interface for reviewing security information, investigating events, and managing monitoring workflows.

Together, these components form the core of the self-hosted monitoring platform.

## Implementation

The deployment work included:

1. Created a virtual machine in Oracle VirtualBox with the required CPU, memory, and disk resources.
2. Installed Ubuntu Server 24.04.5 LTS as the host operating system.
3. Configured NAT and host-only networking for connectivity and lab access.
4. Deployed the Wazuh security monitoring platform and its core components.
5. Established the initial environment for future endpoint integration and security event analysis.

## Current Status

**Completed:** Initial platform deployment and lab environment configuration.

**Planned:** Endpoint onboarding, security event validation, and detection testing.

## Next Steps

- Connect a monitored endpoint to the Wazuh manager.
- Generate controlled security events in the lab.
- Review the resulting events and alerts in the Wazuh dashboard.
- Validate detection behavior and document the results.
- Capture screenshots and investigation notes to demonstrate the lab's functionality.

## Skills Demonstrated

- SIEM deployment and initial configuration
- Linux server administration
- Virtualization and virtual machine provisioning
- Network configuration and troubleshooting
- Security monitoring architecture
- Security event analysis and detection testing preparation

## Project Purpose

This home lab supports continued development of practical cybersecurity skills through hands-on work with security monitoring infrastructure. Future updates will document endpoint integration, detection validation, investigation workflows, and lessons learned as the lab develops.
